### Hello! I'm Brett.
I'm a software engineer and student.
I build dynamic web applications in JavaScript using React / Redux and Express. 
I'm a thoughtful and motivated problem solverâ€” primarily interested in working on projects that better the world.
An artist at heart, I know design and planning is just as important as the end experience.

I believe in beauty, simplicity, and utility.
